# Obligatory Weather App in React
This is a weather app made in React, using the OpenWeatherMap API. <br>
The name is supposed to poke fun at how weather app projects are always recommended for beginners to do. No offense though, I learned more on how to fetch specific data from an API. <br>
I will separate parts of the app into individual components in the future, as I am learning more about React.
